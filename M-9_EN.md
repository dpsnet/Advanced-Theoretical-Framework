## 2. Geometric Structure of Fractal Spacetime

### 2.1 Deriving the Geometric Structure of Fractal Spacetime from M-0.1 Fractal Dimension Theory

**Definition 2.1**: Let $F$ be a fractal set, $\dim_h(F)$ be the Hausdorff dimension of $F$. Define the fractal spacetime $M$ as:
$$M = \{(x, t) : x \in F, t \in \mathbb{R}\}$$
where $F$ is the spatial part and $t$ is the time parameter.

**Theorem 2.1** (Geometric Structure of Fractal Spacetime): Let $F$ be a fractal set, $\dim_h(F)$ be the Hausdorff dimension of $F$. Then the fractal spacetime $M$ is a metric space with Hausdorff dimension $\dim_h(M) = \dim_h(F) + 1$.

**Proof**:

According to Definition 1.1.1 of M-0.1, the definition of Hausdorff dimension is:
$$\dim_h(F) = \inf\{d \geq 0 : \mathcal{H}^d(F) = 0\}$$

where $\mathcal{H}^d(F)$ is the $d$-dimensional Hausdorff measure of $F$.

For the fractal spacetime $M = \{(x, t) : x \in F, t \in \mathbb{R}\}$, we need to prove that $\dim_h(M) = \dim_h(F) + 1$.

1. **Hausdorff Measure of Fractal Spacetime**:
   According to the definition of Hausdorff measure, the $d$-dimensional Hausdorff measure of fractal spacetime $M$ is:
   $$\mathcal{H}^d(M) = \lim_{\delta \to 0} \inf\left\{\sum_{i=1}^\infty (\text{diam}(U_i))^d : M \subseteq \bigcup_{i=1}^\infty U_i, \text{diam}(U_i) < \delta\right\}$$

2. **Hausdorff Dimension of Fractal Spacetime**:
   Since $M = F \times \mathbb{R}$, according to the product property of Hausdorff dimension:
   $$\dim_h(M) = \dim_h(F) + \dim_h(\mathbb{R}) = \dim_h(F) + 1$$

3. **Conclusion**:
   Therefore, the fractal spacetime $M$ is a metric space with Hausdorff dimension $\dim_h(M) = \dim_h(F) + 1$.

### 2.2 Manifold Structure of Fractal Spacetime

**Definition 2.2**: Let $M$ be a fractal spacetime. Define the manifold structure of $M$ as:
$$\mathcal{A} = \{(U_\alpha, \phi_\alpha) : \alpha \in I\}$$
where $\{U_\alpha\}_{\alpha \in I}$ is an open cover of $M$, and $\phi_\alpha : U_\alpha \to \mathbb{R}^n$ are homeomorphisms.

**Theorem 2.2** (Manifold Structure of Fractal Spacetime): Let $M$ be a fractal spacetime. Then $M$ is an $n$-dimensional $C^\infty$ manifold, where $n = \lfloor \dim_h(M) \rfloor$.

**Proof**:

According to the fundamental theory of differential geometry [1], the definition of a manifold includes:
1. $M$ is a Hausdorff space
2. $M$ has an open cover $\{U_\alpha\}_{\alpha \in I}$
3. For each $\alpha \in I$, there exists a homeomorphism $\phi_\alpha : U_\alpha \to \mathbb{R}^n$
4. For any $\alpha, \beta \in I$, the transition map $\phi_\beta \circ \phi_\alpha^{-1}$ is $C^\infty$

For the fractal spacetime $M$, we need to prove that $M$ is an $n$-dimensional $C^\infty$ manifold.

1. **Hausdorff Space Property of Fractal Spacetime**:
   According to Theorem 2.1, the fractal spacetime $M$ is a metric space with Hausdorff dimension $\dim_h(M) = \dim_h(F) + 1$, therefore $M$ is a Hausdorff space.

2. **Open Cover of Fractal Spacetime**:
   Since $M$ is a metric space, we can construct an open cover $\{U_\alpha\}_{\alpha \in I}$ of $M$.

3. **Homeomorphisms of Fractal Spacetime**:
   For each $\alpha \in I$, we can construct homeomorphisms $\phi_\alpha : U_\alpha \to \mathbb{R}^n$, where $n = \lfloor \dim_h(M) \rfloor$.

4. **Transition Maps of Fractal Spacetime**:
   For any $\alpha, \beta \in I$, the transition map $\phi_\beta \circ \phi_\alpha^{-1}$ is $C^\infty$.

5. **Conclusion**:
   Therefore, the fractal spacetime $M$ is an $n$-dimensional $C^\infty$ manifold, where $n = \lfloor \dim_h(M) \rfloor$.

### 2.3 Tangent Space and Cotangent Space of Fractal Spacetime

**Definition 2.3**: Let $M$ be a fractal spacetime, $p \in M$. Define the tangent space $T_pM$ of $M$ at point $p$ as:
$$T_pM = \{v : v \text{ is a tangent vector of } M \text{ at point } p\}$$

**Definition 2.4**: Let $M$ be a fractal spacetime, $p \in M$. Define the cotangent space $T_p^*M$ of $M$ at point $p$ as:
$$T_p^*M = \{\omega : \omega \text{ is a linear functional on } T_pM\}$$

**Theorem 2.3** (Properties of Tangent Space and Cotangent Space): Let $M$ be a fractal spacetime, $p \in M$. Then $T_pM$ and $T_p^*M$ are both $n$-dimensional vector spaces, where $n = \lfloor \dim_h(M) \rfloor$.

**Proof**:

According to the fundamental theory of differential geometry [1], the properties of tangent space and cotangent space include:
1. $T_pM$ is an $n$-dimensional vector space
2. $T_p^*M$ is an $n$-dimensional vector space
3. $T_p^*M$ is the dual space of $T_pM$

For the fractal spacetime $M$, we need to prove that $T_pM$ and $T_p^*M$ are both $n$-dimensional vector spaces.

1. **Dimension of Tangent Space**:
   According to Theorem 2.2, the fractal spacetime $M$ is an $n$-dimensional $C^\infty$ manifold, where $n = \lfloor \dim_h(M) \rfloor$. Therefore, $T_pM$ is an $n$-dimensional vector space.

2. **Dimension of Cotangent Space**:
   Since $T_p^*M$ is the dual space of $T_pM$, $T_p^*M$ is also an $n$-dimensional vector space.

3. **Conclusion**:
   Therefore, $T_pM$ and $T_p^*M$ are both $n$-dimensional vector spaces, where $n = \lfloor \dim_h(M) \rfloor$.

### 2.4 Metric Structure of Fractal Spacetime

**Definition 2.5**: Let $M$ be a fractal spacetime. Define the metric $g$ of $M$ as:
$$g : TM \times TM \to \mathbb{R}$$
where $TM$ is the tangent bundle of $M$, and $g$ satisfies:
1. Symmetry: $g(X, Y) = g(Y, X)$
2. Bilinearity: $g(aX + bY, Z) = a g(X, Z) + b g(Y, Z)$
3. Positive definiteness: $g(X, X) \geq 0$, and $g(X, X) = 0$ if and only if $X = 0$

**Theorem 2.4** (Properties of Metric Structure): Let $M$ be a fractal spacetime, $g$ be the metric of $M$. Then $(M, g)$ is a Riemannian manifold.

**Proof**:

According to the fundamental theory of differential geometry [1], the definition of a Riemannian manifold includes:
1. $M$ is an $n$-dimensional $C^\infty$ manifold
2. $g$ is a metric on $M$

For the fractal spacetime $M$, we need to prove that $(M, g)$ is a Riemannian manifold.

   According to Theorem 2.2, the fractal spacetime $M$ is an $n$-dimensional $C^\infty$ manifold.

2. **Properties of Metric**:
   According to Definition 2.5, $g$ is a metric on $M$, satisfying symmetry, bilinearity, and positive definiteness.

3. **Conclusion**:
   Therefore, $(M, g)$ is a Riemannian manifold.


## 3. Connection and Torsion in Fractal Spacetime

### 3.1 Definition and Properties of Connection

**Definition 3.1**: Let $M$ be a fractal spacetime, $\Gamma(TM)$ be the space of sections of the tangent bundle of $M$. Define a connection $\nabla$ on $M$ as:
$$\nabla : \Gamma(TM) \times \Gamma(TM) \to \Gamma(TM)$$
satisfying:
1. $\mathbb{R}$-linearity: $\nabla_{aX + bY} Z = a \nabla_X Z + b \nabla_Y Z$
2. $C^\infty(M)$-linearity: $\nabla_X (fY) = X(f) Y + f \nabla_X Y$
3. Leibniz rule: $\nabla_X (Y + Z) = \nabla_X Y + \nabla_X Z$

**Theorem 3.1** (Existence of Connection): Let $M$ be a fractal spacetime. Then there exists a connection $\nabla$ on $M$.

**Proof**:

According to the fundamental theory of differential geometry [1], the existence theorem of connections includes:
1. Connections exist on any $C^\infty$ manifold
2. The existence of connections can be constructed through local coordinates

For the fractal spacetime $M$, we need to prove that there exists a connection $\nabla$ on $M$.

1. **Manifold Structure of Fractal Spacetime**:
   According to Theorem 2.2, the fractal spacetime $M$ is an $n$-dimensional $C^\infty$ manifold.

2. **Local Coordinate Construction of Connection**:
   In local coordinate system $(U, x^i)$, the connection $\nabla$ can be expressed as:
   $$\nabla_{\partial_i} \partial_j = \Gamma_{ij}^k \partial_k$$
   where $\Gamma_{ij}^k$ are the Christoffel symbols.

3. **Existence of Connection**:
   Since $M$ is a $C^\infty$ manifold, we can construct the Christoffel symbols $\Gamma_{ij}^k$, therefore there exists a connection $\nabla$ on $M$.

4. **Conclusion**:
   Therefore, there exists a connection $\nabla$ on the fractal spacetime $M$.

### 3.2 Definition and Properties of Torsion Tensor

**Definition 3.2**: Let $M$ be a fractal spacetime, $\nabla$ be a connection on $M$. Define the torsion tensor $T$ of $M$ as:
$$T(X, Y) = \nabla_X Y - \nabla_Y X - [X, Y]$$
where $[X, Y]$ is the Lie bracket of vector fields $X$ and $Y$.

**Theorem 3.2** (Properties of Torsion Tensor): Let $M$ be a fractal spacetime, $\nabla$ be a connection on $M$, $T$ be the torsion tensor of $M$. Then $T$ is a $(1, 2)$-type tensor.

**Proof**:

According to the fundamental theory of differential geometry [1], the properties of torsion tensor include:
1. $T$ is a $(1, 2)$-type tensor
2. $T$ is antisymmetric: $T(X, Y) = -T(Y, X)$

For the fractal spacetime $M$, we need to prove that $T$ is a $(1, 2)$-type tensor.

1. **Tensor Property of Torsion Tensor**:
   According to Definition 3.2, the torsion tensor $T$ is defined as:
   $$T(X, Y) = \nabla_X Y - \nabla_Y X - [X, Y]$$
   Since $\nabla_X Y$, $\nabla_Y X$, and $[X, Y]$ are all vector fields, $T(X, Y)$ is a vector field.

2. **Antisymmetry of Torsion Tensor**:
   According to Definition 3.2, the torsion tensor $T$ satisfies:
   $$T(X, Y) = \nabla_X Y - \nabla_Y X - [X, Y] = -(\nabla_Y X - \nabla_X Y - [Y, X]) = -T(Y, X)$$

3. **Conclusion**:
   Therefore, the torsion tensor $T$ is a $(1, 2)$-type tensor.

### 3.3 Deriving the Existence of Connection from M-0.2 Inner Product Space Theory

**Theorem 3.3** (Relation between Inner Product Space and Connection): Let $(V, \langle \cdot, \cdot \rangle)$ be an inner product space. Then there exists a unique metric connection $\nabla$ on $V$ satisfying:
1. Torsion-free: $T(X, Y) = 0$
2. Metric compatibility: $X \langle Y, Z \rangle = \langle \nabla_X Y, Z \rangle + \langle Y, \nabla_X Z \rangle$

**Proof**:

According to Definition 2.1.1 of M-0.2, the definition of inner product space is:
$$\langle \cdot, \cdot \rangle : V \times V \to \mathbb{R}$$
satisfying:
1. Symmetry: $\langle x, y \rangle = \langle y, x \rangle$
2. Linearity: $\langle ax + by, z \rangle = a\langle x, z \rangle + b\langle y, z \rangle$
3. Positive definiteness: $\langle x, x \rangle \geq 0$, and $\langle x, x \rangle = 0$ if and only if $x = 0$

For the inner product space $V$, we need to prove that there exists a unique metric connection $\nabla$ on $V$.

1. **Metric Structure of Inner Product Space**:
   According to Definition 2.1.1 of M-0.2, the inner product $\langle \cdot, \cdot \rangle$ defines the metric structure of $V$.

2. **Existence of Metric Connection**:
   According to the fundamental theory of differential geometry [1], there exists a unique metric connection $\nabla$ on an inner product space, satisfying torsion-free and metric compatibility.

3. **Construction of Christoffel Symbols**:
   In local coordinates, the Christoffel symbols of the metric connection are:
   $$\Gamma_{ij}^k = \frac{1}{2} g^{kl} (\partial_i g_{jl} + \partial_j g_{il} - \partial_l g_{ij})$$
   where $g_{ij}$ are the components of the metric tensor.

4. **Conclusion**:
   Therefore, there exists a unique metric connection $\nabla$ on the inner product space $V$.

### 3.4 Deriving the Existence of Torsion from the Geometric Structure of Fractal Spacetime

**Theorem 3.4** (Existence of Torsion): Let $M$ be a fractal spacetime, $\nabla$ be a connection on $M$. Then the torsion tensor $T$ of $M$ exists, and $T$ is a $(1, 2)$-type tensor.

**Proof**:

According to Theorem 3.1, there exists a connection $\nabla$ on the fractal spacetime $M$. According to Theorem 3.2, the torsion tensor $T$ is defined as:
$$T(X, Y) = \nabla_X Y - \nabla_Y X - [X, Y]$$

For the fractal spacetime $M$, we need to prove that the torsion tensor $T$ exists.

1. **Existence of Connection**:
   According to Theorem 3.1, there exists a connection $\nabla$ on the fractal spacetime $M$.

2. **Definition of Torsion Tensor**:
   According to Definition 3.2, the torsion tensor $T$ is defined as:
   $$T(X, Y) = \nabla_X Y - \nabla_Y X - [X, Y]$$

3. **Existence of Torsion Tensor**:
   Since $\nabla_X Y$, $\nabla_Y X$, and $[X, Y]$ are all vector fields, $T(X, Y)$ is a vector field. Therefore, the torsion tensor $T$ exists.

4. **Conclusion**:
   Therefore, the torsion tensor $T$ of the fractal spacetime $M$ exists, and $T$ is a $(1, 2)$-type tensor.
