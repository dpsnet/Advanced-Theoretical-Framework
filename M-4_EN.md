## Preface: From Static Topology to Dynamic Topology

In M-3, we developed a static topological theory based on multiple torsion, interpreting particle spin as longitudinal torsion of spacetime fibers. However, physical phenomena in nature involve not only static topological structures but also rich dynamic changes. This module further develops dynamic topology theory, introducing the concept of **transverse kaleidoscope dynamic topology**, organically combining static longitudinal torsion with dynamic transverse topological transformations to form composite topological structures.

**Topological Analogy:** We can analogize the composite topological structure to a "twisted hemp rope with kaleidoscope effects":
- **Longitudinal Topology:** The longitudinal torsion of the hemp rope, corresponding to the multiple torsion topology in M-3, describes the spin properties of particles
- **Transverse Dynamic Topology:** The kaleidoscope dynamic patterns on the hemp rope surface, corresponding to the dynamic topological transformations introduced in this module, describes the dynamic characteristics of spacetime
- **Composite Effect:** Longitudinal torsion determines the basic structure of the hemp rope, while transverse dynamic topology produces rich surface pattern variations

Through this composite topological structure, we can more comprehensively describe the complexity of spacetime, from static structures to dynamic changes, from microscopic particles to the macroscopic universe.

## 1 Mathematical Foundations of Dynamic Topology

### 1.1 Definition and Construction of Dynamic Fiber Bundles

Based on the fiber bundle theory in M-2, we define dynamic fiber bundles as **parameterized fiber bundles**, introducing dynamic parameters to describe topological transformations of fiber bundles.

**Definition 1.1.1** (Dynamic Fiber Bundle): Let $B$ be a 4-dimensional base manifold (spacetime), $F$ be the fiber space, $G$ be the structure group, $P$ be the total space, $\pi: P \to B$ be the projection mapping. If the connection 1-form $\omega$ of the fiber bundle depends on dynamic parameter $t \in T$ ($T$ is the parameter space), i.e.:
$$\omega_t: TP \to \mathfrak{g}$$
then $(P,B,F,G,\pi,\omega_t)$ is called a **dynamic fiber bundle**.

**Geometric Realization:** Dynamic fiber bundles can be realized through the dynamic crossed product of base manifold $B$ and fiber space $F$:
- Fiber space $F$ varies with dynamic parameter $t$: $F_t = \phi_t(F_0)$, where $\phi_t$ is the dynamic transformation
- Connection 1-form $\omega_t$ satisfies the covariant derivative condition: $D_t \omega_t = 0$, where $D_t$ is the dynamic covariant derivative
- Curvature 2-form $\Omega_t = d\omega_t + \frac{1}{2}[\omega_t, \omega_t]$ describes the rate of change of dynamic topology

**Physical Significance:** Dynamic fiber bundles describe the dynamic changes of spacetime topology, providing a mathematical framework for spacetime foam in quantum gravity, dynamic characteristics of dark matter, etc.

### 1.2 Dynamic Extension of Twisted Clifford Algebras

Based on the twisted Clifford algebra in M-3, we introduce **dynamic torsion parameters** to extend it to dynamically twisted Clifford algebras.

**Definition 1.2.1** (Dynamic Twisted Clifford Algebra): Let $V$ be a 4-dimensional vector space, $Q$ be the Minkowski quadratic form, $\tau(t)$ be the dynamic torsion parameter, and $\gamma^\mu(t)$ be the dynamic generators. Then the **dynamic twisted Clifford algebra** $\mathcal{Cl}(3,1;\tau(t))$ is generated by generators $\gamma^\mu(t)$ satisfying the following relations:
$$\{\gamma^\mu(t), \gamma^\nu(t)\} = 2g^{\mu\nu}I + \tau_{\mu\nu}(t)$$
where $\tau_{\mu\nu}(t)$ is the dynamic torsion tensor, characterizing the strength and direction of dynamic topological transformations.

**Theorem 1.2.2** (Dynamic Generator Evolution Equation): Dynamic generators satisfy the following evolution equation:
$$\frac{d\gamma^\mu(t)}{dt} = [\gamma^\mu(t), \Gamma(t)]$$
where $\Gamma(t)$ is the generator of dynamic transformations, describing the dynamics of topological transformations.

**Proof:**
1. **Group Action of Dynamic Transformations:** Dynamic topological transformations are described by group $G_t$, with generator $\Gamma(t)$, satisfying:
   $$g(t) = e^{t\Gamma(t)}$$

2. **Group Transformation of Generators:** Dynamic generators $\gamma^\mu(t)$ satisfy under group transformation:
   $$\gamma^\mu(t + dt) = g(dt)\gamma^\mu(t)g(dt)^{-1}$$

3. **Taylor Expansion:** Taylor expanding $g(dt)$, keeping terms up to first order:
   $$g(dt) = I + dt\Gamma(t) + O(dt^2)$$
   $$g(dt)^{-1} = I - dt\Gamma(t) + O(dt^2)$$

4. **Evolution Equation Derivation:**
   $$\gamma^\mu(t + dt) = (I + dt\Gamma(t))\gamma^\mu(t)(I - dt\Gamma(t))$$
   $$= \gamma^\mu(t) + dt[\Gamma(t), \gamma^\mu(t)] + O(dt^2)$$

5. **Time Derivative Definition:**
   $$\frac{d\gamma^\mu(t)}{dt} = \lim_{dt\to0}\frac{\gamma^\mu(t + dt) - \gamma^\mu(t)}{dt} = [\gamma^\mu(t), \Gamma(t)]$$

**Physical Significance:** The evolution equation of dynamic generators describes the temporal variation law of generators, reflecting the dynamic characteristics of topological transformations.

**Theorem 1.2.1** (Existence of Irreducible Representations): The dynamic twisted Clifford algebra has irreducible representations at any time $t$, with the same dimension as the standard Clifford algebra ($2^4=16$ dimensions), and the representation space evolves dynamically over time.

**Proof:**
1. **Algebraic Structure at Fixed Time:** For any fixed time $t_0$, the dynamic twisted Clifford algebra $\mathcal{Cl}(3,1;\tau(t_0))$ reduces to the static twisted Clifford algebra, whose generators satisfy:
   $$\{\gamma^\mu(t_0), \gamma^\nu(t_0)\} = 2g^{\mu\nu}I + \tau_{\mu\nu}(t_0)$$

2. **Unitary Transformation Diagonalization:** There exists a unitary transformation $U(t_0)$ such that:
   $$U(t_0)\gamma^\mu(t_0)U(t_0)^{-1} = \widetilde{\gamma}^\mu(t_0)$$
   where $\widetilde{\gamma}^\mu(t_0)$ satisfies the standard Clifford algebra relations:
   $$\{\widetilde{\gamma}^\mu(t_0), \widetilde{\gamma}^\nu(t_0)\} = 2g^{\mu\nu}I$$

3. **Irreducible Representations of Standard Clifford Algebra:** The standard Clifford algebra $\mathcal{Cl}(3,1)$ has irreducible representations with dimension $2^{4/2}=16$ dimensions (M-1).

4. **Dynamic Irreducible Representations:** Through unitary transformation $U(t)$, we can convert the irreducible representation $\rho$ of the standard Clifford algebra to the irreducible representation $\rho_t$ of the dynamic twisted Clifford algebra:
   $$\rho_t(\gamma^\mu(t)) = \rho(U(t)^{-1}\widetilde{\gamma}^\mu(t)U(t))$$

5. **Dimension Invariance:** Unitary transformations do not change the dimension of representations, therefore the dimension of irreducible representations of the dynamic twisted Clifford algebra is the same as that of the standard Clifford algebra, which is 16 dimensions.

**Corollary:** All irreducible representations of the dynamic twisted Clifford algebra are equivalent and isomorphic to the irreducible representations of the standard Clifford algebra.

### 1.3 Dynamic Topological Transformation Groups

Based on the group theory foundations in M-1, we define **dynamic topological transformation groups** to describe the symmetries of topological transformations.

**Definition 1.3.1** (Dynamic Topological Transformation Group): Let $G$ be a static topological transformation group, $T$ be the parameter space. If there exists a continuous mapping $\phi: T \times G \to G$, satisfying:
1. $\phi(0,g) = g$, for any $g \in G$
2. $\phi(t_1, \phi(t_2, g)) = \phi(t_1 + t_2, g)$, for any $t_1, t_2 \in T, g \in G$
3. $\phi(t, \cdot)$ is an automorphism of $G$, for any $t \in T$

Then $G_t = \{\phi(t,g) | g \in G\}$ is called a **dynamic topological transformation group**.

**Physical Significance:** Dynamic topological transformation groups describe the symmetric transformations of spacetime topology, with different group structures corresponding to different physical symmetries.

## 2 Composite Structure of Longitudinal Multiple Torsion and Transverse Dynamic Topology

### 2.1 Definition of Composite Topological Space

Based on the multiple torsion topology in M-3, we define composite topological space as the direct product of longitudinal multiple torsion topology and transverse dynamic topology.

**Definition 2.1.1** (Composite Topological Space): Let $(X,d,\mu)$ be a 4-dimensional generalized regular space. If its measure field $\mu$ satisfies:
1. **Longitudinal Multiple Torsion Condition** (M-3): $\nabla_{\mu_1}\nabla_{\mu_2}\cdots\nabla_{\mu_n}\ln\mu(x) \neq 0, \quad n \geq 2$
2. **Transverse Dynamic Topology Condition**: $\mu(x,t) = \mu_0(x) \cdot f(x,t)$, where $f(x,t)$ is a periodic dynamic transformation function, satisfying $f(x,t + T) = f(x,t)$

Then $(X,d,\mu(x,t))$ is called a **composite topological space**.

**Mathematical Structure:** The composite topological space can be represented as the direct product of longitudinal topological space $X_L$ and transverse dynamic topological space $X_T(t)$:
$$X = X_L \times X_T(t)$$

where $X_L$ is the multiple torsion spacetime in M-3, and $X_T(t)$ is the transverse dynamic topological space evolving with time $t$.

### 2.2 Geometric Realization of Composite Topology

Composite topological spaces can be realized through **the composite of longitudinal torsion and transverse dynamic transformation of fiber bundles**.

**Geometric Construction:**
1. **Longitudinal Construction:** Attach Möbius strip-like torsion to each dimension of 4-dimensional spacetime, forming a longitudinal multiple torsion structure (M-3)
2. **Transverse Construction:** On the basis of longitudinal torsion, introduce transverse dynamic transformations, forming a dynamic topological effect similar to kaleidoscopes
3. **Composite Effect:** Longitudinal torsion determines the basic topological structure of spacetime, while transverse dynamic transformations produce rich dynamic topological changes

**Mathematical Description:** The measure field of the composite topological space can be expressed as:
$$\mu(x,t) = \mu_L(x) \cdot \mu_T(x,t)$$

where $\mu_L(x)$ is the longitudinal multiple torsion measure field, and $\mu_T(x,t)$ is the transverse dynamic topological measure field.

### 2.3 Measure Field Description of Composite Topology

Based on the fractal measure theory in M-2, we represent the measure field of composite topology as the product of longitudinal multiple torsion measure and transverse dynamic measure.

**Definition 2.3.1** (Composite Fractal Measure): The fractal measure $\mu(x,t)$ of composite topological space satisfies:
$$\mu(B(x,r),t) \sim r^{Q(x,t)}$$
where $Q(x,t)$ is the dynamic Ahlfors exponent, describing changes in dynamic spectral dimension.

**Evolution Equation of Dynamic Ahlfors Exponent:**
$$\frac{dQ(x,t)}{dt} = \alpha(x) \nabla^2 Q(x,t) + \beta(x) \cdot |\nabla Q(x,t)|^2$$

where $\alpha(x)$ and $\beta(x)$ are dynamic topological coefficients, describing the influence of dynamic topological transformations on spectral dimension.

**Physical Significance:** The dynamic Ahlfors exponent describes the dynamic changes of effective spacetime dimensions, providing mathematical tools for understanding spacetime foam in quantum gravity, dynamic characteristics of dark energy, etc.

## 3 Mathematical Model of Kaleidoscope Effect

### 3.1 Mathematical Description of Kaleidoscope Transformations

The core of the kaleidoscope effect is **periodic symmetric transformations**, which we mathematically describe as periodic reflection transformations of measure fields.

**Definition 3.1.1** (Kaleidoscope Transformation): Let $f(x)$ be a function defined on $X$. If there exists a finite group $G$ (reflection group), such that for any $g \in G$:
$$f(gx) = f(x)$$
then $f(x)$ is said to have **kaleidoscope symmetry**.

**Dynamic Extension:** Dynamic kaleidoscope transformations introduce time parameters, allowing the symmetry group $G_t$ to vary with time:
$$f_t(g_t x) = f_t(x), \quad \forall g_t \in G_t$$

where $G_t$ is the dynamic reflection group, describing the dynamic changes of kaleidoscope effects.

**Geometric Realization:** Dynamic kaleidoscope transformations can be realized through periodic convolution of measure fields:
$$\mu_T(x,t) = \mu_0(x) \star h_t(x)$$

where $h_t(x)$ is a periodic dynamic kernel function, satisfying $h_t(x + T) = h_t(x)$.

### 3.2 Periodic Dynamic Transformations of Measure Fields

Based on the measure field theory in M-2, we describe periodic dynamic transformations of measure fields as **Fourier transforms of measure fields**.

**Theorem 3.2.1** (Periodic Transformations of Measure Fields): Let $\mu_T(x,t)$ be the transverse dynamic measure field, satisfying the periodic condition $\mu_T(x,t + T) = \mu_T(x,t)$. Then its Fourier transform is:
$$\hat{\mu}_T(k,t) = \sum_{n=-\infty}^{\infty} c_n(k) e^{i n \omega t}$$

where $\omega = 2\pi/T$ is the angular frequency, and $c_n(k)$ are Fourier coefficients, describing the amplitudes of different frequency components.

**Proof:**
1. **Fourier Series of Periodic Functions:** For fixed $k$, $\hat{\mu}_T(k,t)$ is a periodic function of $t$ with period $T$, so it can be expanded as a Fourier series:
   $$\hat{\mu}_T(k,t) = \sum_{n=-\infty}^{\infty} c_n(k) e^{i n \omega t}$$
   where $\omega = 2\pi/T$, and $c_n(k)$ are Fourier coefficients.

2. **Calculation of Fourier Coefficients:**
   $$c_n(k) = \frac{1}{T}\int_0^T \hat{\mu}_T(k,t) e^{-i n \omega t} dt$$

3. **Periodicity Guarantee of Measure Fields:** Since $\mu_T(x,t)$ satisfies the periodic condition, its Fourier transform $\hat{\mu}_T(k,t)$ also necessarily satisfies the periodic condition, so the Fourier series expansion converges.

4. **Inverse Transformation Verification:** Performing inverse transformation on the Fourier series:
   $$\mu_T(x,t) = \frac{1}{(2\pi)^4}\int d^4k \sum_{n=-\infty}^{\infty} c_n(k) e^{i(k\cdot x + n \omega t)}$$
   This shows that the transverse dynamic measure field can be decomposed into superpositions of plane waves of different frequencies, consistent with the physical picture of periodic dynamic transformations.

**Physical Significance:** Periodic dynamic transformations of measure fields can be decomposed into superpositions of different frequency components, providing mathematical tools for studying the spectral characteristics of dynamic topological effects.

### 3.3 Topological Invariants of Kaleidoscope Effect

Based on the topological invariant theory in M-3, we calculate topological invariants of the kaleidoscope effect and establish physical correspondences.

**Definition 3.3.1** (Dynamic Topological Invariants): Let $(X,d,\mu(x,t))$ be a composite topological space. If there exists a functional $I[\mu(x,t)]$, satisfying:
1. **Topological Invariance:** $I[\mu(x,t)] = I[\phi^* \mu(x,t)]$, for any topological transformation $\phi$
2. **Dynamic Invariance:** $I[\mu(x,t)] = I[\mu(x,t + T)]$, for any time $t$

Then $I[\mu(x,t)]$ is called a **dynamic topological invariant**.

**Calculation Method:** Dynamic topological invariants can be calculated through higher-order moments of measure fields:
$$I_n = \int_X (\nabla^n \ln\mu(x,t))^2 d\mu(x,t)$$

**Physical Significance:** Dynamic topological invariants describe the essential characteristics of composite topological structures, unchanged by dynamic transformations, providing mathematical tools for identifying different physical states.

## 4 Relationship Between Dynamic Topology and Spectral Dimension Flow

### 4.1 Influence Mechanism of Dynamic Topology on Spectral Dimension

Based on the spectral dimension theory in M-2, we explore the influence mechanism of dynamic topological transformations on spectral dimension flow.

**Theorem 4.1.1** (Relationship Between Dynamic Topology and Spectral Dimension): The spectral dimension $d_s(t)$ of composite topological space satisfies:
$$d_s(t) = d_{s,L} + d_{s,T}(t)$$

where $d_{s,L}$ is the spectral dimension of longitudinal multiple torsion (static), and $d_{s,T}(t)$ is the spectral dimension of transverse dynamic topology (dynamic).

**Proof:**
1. **Heat Kernel Trace of Composite Topological Space:** The heat kernel trace of composite topological space $X = X_L \times X_T(t)$ is the product of longitudinal and transverse heat kernel traces:
   $$\text{Tr}(e^{-tD^2}) = \text{Tr}_L(e^{-tD_L^2}) \cdot \text{Tr}_T(e^{-tD_T^2(t)})$$
   where $D_L$ is the Dirac operator of longitudinal multiple torsion spacetime, and $D_T(t)$ is the Dirac operator of transverse dynamic topological space.

2. **Definition of Spectral Dimension:** The spectral dimension $d_s(t)$ is defined by the asymptotic behavior of the heat kernel trace (M-2):
   $$d_s(t) = -2\lim_{t\to0^+}\frac{\ln\text{Tr}(e^{-tD^2})}{\ln t}$$

3. **Longitudinal and Transverse Spectral Dimensions:** Similarly, longitudinal and transverse spectral dimensions are:
   $$d_{s,L} = -2\lim_{t\to0^+}\frac{\ln\text{Tr}_L(e^{-tD_L^2})}{\ln t}$$
   $$d_{s,T}(t) = -2\lim_{t\to0^+}\frac{\ln\text{Tr}_T(e^{-tD_T^2(t)})}{\ln t}$$

4. **Logarithmic Decomposition of Product:**
   $$\ln\text{Tr}(e^{-tD^2}) = \ln\text{Tr}_L(e^{-tD_L^2}) + \ln\text{Tr}_T(e^{-tD_T^2(t)})$$

5. **Linearity of Limit:**
   $$d_s(t) = -2\lim_{t\to0^+}\left(\frac{\ln\text{Tr}_L(e^{-tD_L^2})}{\ln t} + \frac{\ln\text{Tr}_T(e^{-tD_T^2(t)})}{\ln t}\right) = d_{s,L} + d_{s,T}(t)$$

**Physical Significance:** Dynamic topological transformations affect the total spectral dimension $d_s(t)$ by influencing the transverse spectral dimension $d_{s,T}(t)$, providing a new mechanism for understanding spectral dimension flow in quantum gravity.

**Corollary:** When transverse dynamic topology disappears ($d_{s,T}(t) = 0$), the composite spectral dimension reduces to the longitudinal spectral dimension, consistent with the results in M-3.

### 4.2 Correction of Dynamic Spectral Dimension Flow Equations

Based on the spectral dimension flow equation in M-2, we introduce dynamic topological correction terms to obtain the dynamic spectral dimension flow equation.

**Theorem 4.2.1** (Dynamic Spectral Dimension Flow Equation): Considering dynamic topological effects, the spectral dimension flow equation is corrected to:
$$\mu \frac{d d_s(t)}{d\mu} + \frac{d d_s(t)}{dt} = \alpha (d_s(t) - 4)^2 (d_s(t) - 1) + \beta \cdot \nabla^2 d_s(t)$$

where $\beta$ is the dynamic topological coefficient, describing the influence strength of dynamic topology on spectral dimension flow.

**Proof:**
1. **Preliminary Lemma:** The energy scale flow equation of spectral dimension $d_s$ (M-2) is:
   $$\mu \frac{d d_s}{d\mu} = \alpha (d_s - 4)^2 (d_s - 1)$$

2. **Dynamic Topological Correction Term:** Considering dynamic topological effects, spectral dimension varies with time $t$, so a time derivative term needs to be added:
   $$\frac{d d_s(t)}{dt} = -\beta \cdot \nabla^2 d_s(t)$$
   where the negative sign indicates that dynamic topological effects tend to suppress spatial variations of spectral dimension, and $\beta > 0$ is the dynamic topological coefficient.

3. **Combined Equation:** Combining energy scale flow terms and dynamic topological correction terms, we obtain the dynamic spectral dimension flow equation:
   $$\mu \frac{d d_s(t)}{d\mu} + \frac{d d_s(t)}{dt} = \alpha (d_s(t) - 4)^2 (d_s(t) - 1) + \beta \cdot \nabla^2 d_s(t)$$

4. **Physical Interpretation:**
   - First term on the left: Spectral dimension change caused by energy scale flow
   - Second term on the left: Spectral dimension change caused by time evolution
   - First term on the right: Traditional RG flow term
   - Second term on the right: Spatial diffusion term caused by dynamic topology

**Physical Significance:** The dynamic spectral dimension flow equation describes the evolution of spectral dimension with energy scale $\mu$ and time $t$, providing a mathematical description of dynamic characteristics of spacetime in quantum gravity.

### 4.3 Heat Kernel Estimates Under Dynamic Topology

Based on the heat kernel estimate theory in M-2, we calculate the heat kernel trace under dynamic topology and establish its relationship with spectral dimension.

**Theorem 4.3.1** (Heat Kernel Estimates Under Dynamic Topology): The heat kernel trace of dynamic topological space satisfies:
$$\text{Tr}(e^{-tD^2}) \sim t^{-d_s(t)/2} \cdot f(t)$$

where $f(t)$ is the dynamic correction factor, describing the periodic variations of the heat kernel trace.

**Proof:**
1. **Heat Kernel Decomposition of Dynamic Topological Space:** The heat kernel of dynamic topological space can be decomposed into the product of longitudinal and transverse heat kernels:
   $$K(t,x,y) = K_L(t,x_L,y_L) \cdot K_T(t,x_T,y_T,t)$$
   where $K_L$ is the heat kernel of longitudinal multiple torsion spacetime, and $K_T$ is the heat kernel of transverse dynamic topological space.

2. **Calculation of Heat Kernel Trace:** The heat kernel trace is the diagonal integral of the heat kernel:
   $$\text{Tr}(e^{-tD^2}) = \int_X K(t,x,x) d\mu(x) = \int_{X_L} K_L(t,x_L,x_L) d\mu_L(x_L) \cdot \int_{X_T(t)} K_T(t,x_T,x_T,t) d\mu_T(x_T,t)$$

3. **Asymptotic Behavior of Longitudinal Heat Kernel** (M-2):
   $$\int_{X_L} K_L(t,x_L,x_L) d\mu_L(x_L) \sim t^{-d_{s,L}/2}$$

4. **Asymptotic Behavior of Transverse Heat Kernel:**
   $$\int_{X_T(t)} K_T(t,x_T,x_T,t) d\mu_T(x_T,t) \sim t^{-d_{s,T}(t)/2} \cdot f(t)$$
   where $f(t)$ is the dynamic correction factor, describing the periodic variations of the transverse heat kernel.

5. **Asymptotic Behavior of Composite Heat Kernel Trace:**
   $$\text{Tr}(e^{-tD^2}) \sim t^{-d_{s,L}/2} \cdot t^{-d_{s,T}(t)/2} \cdot f(t) = t^{-(d_{s,L} + d_{s,T}(t))/2} \cdot f(t) = t^{-d_s(t)/2} \cdot f(t)$$
   where $d_s(t) = d_{s,L} + d_{s,T}(t)$ is the composite spectral dimension.

**Physical Significance:** Heat kernel estimates under dynamic topology provide mathematical tools for calculating dynamic spectral dimensions and exploring dynamic characteristics of spacetime in quantum gravity. The periodic correction factor $f(t)$ of the heat kernel trace reflects the influence of dynamic topological effects.

## 5 Topological Invariants and Physical Correspondences

### 5.1 Topological Invariant Calculations for Composite Topology

Based on the topological invariant theory in M-3, we calculate topological invariants of composite topological structures and establish physical correspondences.

**Calculation Results:**
1. **Longitudinal Topological Invariants:** Consistent with M-3, describing the spin properties of particles
2. **Transverse Dynamic Topological Invariants:**
   - Period invariant: $T$ (topological transformation period)
   - Frequency invariant: $\omega = 2\pi/T$ (topological oscillation frequency)
   - Amplitude invariant: $A$ (topological transformation amplitude)
3. **Composite Topological Invariants:**
   - Coupling invariant: $\chi = d_{s,L} \cdot d_{s,T}(t)$ (coupling of longitudinal and transverse spectral dimensions)
   - Dynamic invariant: $I = \int_0^T d_s(t) dt$ (time-averaged spectral dimension)

### 5.2 Correspondence Between Topological Invariants and Particle Physics

We establish correspondences between composite topological invariants and particle physics:

| Topological Invariant | Physical Correspondence | Description |
|-----------------------|-------------------------|-------------|
| Longitudinal torsion order $n$ | Particle spin $s$ | $s = n/2$ |
| Dynamic transformation period $T$ | Particle lifetime $\tau$ | $T \sim \tau$ |
| Dynamic transformation frequency $\omega$ | Particle energy $E$ | $\omega \sim E/\hbar$ |
| Dynamic transformation amplitude $A$ | Particle interaction strength $g$ | $A \sim g$ |

**Physical Significance:** Through composite topological invariants, we can uniformly interpret the fundamental properties of particles (spin, lifetime, energy, interaction strength) as characteristics of composite topological structures, providing a geometric foundation for particle physics.

### 5.3 Connection Between Topological Invariants and Dark Matter

Based on the dark matter theory in P-5, we explore the connection between composite topological invariants and dark matter.

**Hypothesis 5.3.1** (Dynamic Topology Model of Dark Matter): Dark matter particles correspond to undetected dynamic topological modes in composite topological space, with their physical properties determined by composite topological invariants.

**Explanation of Dark Matter Characteristics:**
- **Invisibility:** Dark matter corresponds to transverse dynamic topological modes, orthogonal to the longitudinal topological modes of visible matter
- **Weak Interaction:** The coupling invariant $\chi$ of dynamic topological modes is small
- **Dark Matter Halo:** Periodic transformations of dynamic topological modes form dark matter halo structures
- **Connection to Dark Energy:** Collective effects of dynamic topological modes may correspond to dark energy

**Physical Significance:** Composite topology theory provides new theoretical perspectives for cosmological problems such as dark matter and dark energy, uniformly interpreting them as dynamic characteristics of spacetime topology.

**Proof:**
1. When $t$ is fixed, the dynamic torsion parameter $\tau(t)$ is constant, and the dynamic twisted Clifford algebra reduces to the static twisted Clifford algebra (M-3)
